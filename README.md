## Problem Statement

### Business Context

From children to adults to the elderly, the importance of a balanced diet cannot be emphasized enough for any age group to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A proper, well-balanced meal plan helps attain an ideal body weight and reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and other types of cancer.

The **Health Company**, which provides various diet plans for weight loss, conducted a market test experiment to test three different kinds of diets (A, B, C). Each of the volunteers was given one of the three diet plans and asked to follow the diet for 6 weeks.

### Objective

To understand the effectiveness of each of the different diets for weight loss across various age groups, the executives of the company reached out to you, a data scientist at the company. The weights before starting the diet and the weight 6 weeks after following the diet were recorded for 78 volunteers across different age groups who were provided with one of the three diet plans. 

Your task is to perform a statistical analysis to find evidence of whether the mean weight losses with respect to the three diet plans and different age groups are significantly different.
